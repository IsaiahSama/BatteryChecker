# Battery Checker

## Setting up

Setting up is simple. First, go to the [Python website link here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.7/python-3.8.7-amd64.exe) which will start your python download. When the installer begins, tick the checkbox that says "Add to Path", and then press continue and go through the rest of the installer. 

After the installer is complete, you have now installed python and you are ready to run python programs. Return to this page and press the green button near the top that says Code, press it, and then press Download Zip. 

With the zip file downloaded, simply extract it using your method of choice, putting them in a folder of your choice (remember to keep the main.py file in the same folder as the mechanics.py file). As I have used an external module for this program, in order for it to work, you will also have to have the same module, which is honestly very easy to get. Go to the folder where you have the files, and click the bar near the top of your file explorer, where your file path is shown (Something like "This PC > Desktop > MyFolder). When you click this bar, remove all the text, type cmd and press enter. This will open your command prompt. In your command prompt now, type "pip install -r requirements.txt". This will install the required packages. When that is completed, this program is now ready to use. 

From here just double click the main.py file to run it. Easy. I hope this comes in handy. If you have any queries or problems, feel free to email me at isaiahahmadsama@gmail.com with them. Enjoy.
